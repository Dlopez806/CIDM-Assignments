Assignment 4 - Developing Design Specifications

## Reflections

### Learning through Iteration
The journey through developing the CIS Degree Program Management System has been a blend of challenges, learning, and iterative improvements. Initially, translating the real-world processes of a degree program into an ERD proved to be a challenge. My first attempts were not in natural language and were over-complicated, reflecting a lack of understanding of the underlying relationships between entities.

However, revisiting the requirements, consulting additional resources on degree program structures, and reviewing the feedback from my professor, I was able to simplify the design, making it more intuitive and closer to natural language. This iterative process, though time-consuming, was incredibly educational and helped in better understanding both the domain and the technical implementation.

### User Story Examples
- **Viewing Degree Requirements**: As a Student, I want to view the degree requirements for the program, so that I can understand the courses required to complete the program.

- **Checking Course Equivalency**: As a Transfer Student, I want to check the equivalency of external courses, so that I can understand how my previous coursework aligns with the program requirements.

- **Updating Course Information**: As an Administrator, I want to update course information, so that students have the most current information available.

- **Viewing Semester Course Offerings**: As a Student, I want to view courses offered in a particular semester, so that I can plan my schedule for the semester.

- **Viewing Course Prerequisites**: As a Student, I want to view the prerequisites for a course, so that I can ensure I am eligible to enroll in the course.

- **Submitting Transfer Course Evaluations**: As a Transfer Student, I want to submit external course information for evaluation, so that I can receive credit towards the desired degree.

- **Checking Degree Progress**: As a Student, I want to check my progress towards degree completion, so that I can stay on track to graduate.

- **Viewing Historical Grade Information**: As a Student, I want to view grades from previous semesters, so that I can understand my academic performance over time.

- **Updating Elective Course Groups**: As an Administrator, I want to update groups of elective courses, so that I can reflect the most current program requirements.

## Future Improvements
Going forward, I plan on refining the ERD, improving the user interface, and incorporating more complex functionalities like tracking student progress through their degree program, and implementing a feature for administrators to update course details and student profiles.
